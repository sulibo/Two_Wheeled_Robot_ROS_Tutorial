This repository contains the codes for the tutorial ["Exploring ROS using a two-wheeled robot" by Marco Arruda](https://www.theconstructsim.com/ros-projects-exploring-ros-using-2-wheeled-robot-part-1/). 

The original tutorial uses ROS Development Studio by the Construct to create the ROS packages. The codes in this repository is a reimplementation of the ROSDS project in the original tutorial. You can run the ROS packages in your local machine.  

The packages are tested on ROS Noetic Ninjemys.
